## Welcome To My Github ðŸ‘‹

My name's Hengrui, I'm a CS + Math minor student at Northeastern! I like trying out random/new things, which include:
- Writing (I did it for a bit to keep me accountable https://medium.com/@asian420)
- Playing Sports
- Watching the NBA
- Scrolling on Reels
- Reading
- Eating
- Yapping
- Listening to Music (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3UMDhVNytQriTnfSo82t1w?si=45a21776d44849d5)

Right now I'm researching for the Neuromechanics Lab at Northeastern, developing my own side project, and I'm a software engineer for SUITS@NU.
